### Vaultoro

### CODE CHALLENGE FEEDBACK

Philip, I completed all tasks including the bonus. I didn't focus on the look&feel of the exercise, as didn't found that on the requirements.

Overall I found the exercise very interesting. It really gets you deep diving into meteor framework.

* I have missed some styling requirements, basically I haven't touched much styles because the exercise didn't require to do so, besides the background color :), 

- how are you able to test the proficency of a FE candidate with no exercises around styles?

* I found the initial tasks very trivial. E.g. I would have expected to have more tasks related to data handling with ES6 map, reduce, assign, etc. 

- Do you know if redux can be used in the meteor/pup stack?


I look forward to talking to you, regarding the code challenge and to discuss any further steps for Vaultoro position. 


best,
pablo
